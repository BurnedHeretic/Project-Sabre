![Halo Classic Covers Splash](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68188926-b9ee-4b04-99fe-79c946c8c26b)

Experience classic Halo as they were meant to be played through Halo The Master Chief Collection. Sabre Launcher is a custom built launcher, developed in UE5 that combines all the classic Halo menus into one universal launcher. 

Please be aware this is heavily WIP and may contain bugs or unfinished assets.

Due to direct level launching via Command Line being no longer supported in MCC, it is not possible to directly launch from Sabre into a specific games campaign or MP. I have thus developed a workaround using scripts and UE5s console command blueprints and attempted to make this as seamless as possible.
